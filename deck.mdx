<Notes>

The following history will skip the whole Virtual Machine world that VMWare is popular for.
The following will be a history solely of containerization.

<Notes>

Jacques GÃ©linas builds the VServer project.
This was the first time anyone had separated the user space environment on a server into separate units.
It kickstarted the term 'VPS' or Virtual Private Server.
Moreover, it made it appear like several servers to all processes.

<Notes>

Cgroups are born partially out of Red Hat, partially by Paul Menage at Google.
Cgroups are a collection of memory/cpu/disk io.
They were revoulitionary because they enforced that each group wouldn't be able to starve resources from another.

So we have the ability to manage resources and the ability to separate space on a server into small units.
We are close to full containerization.

# 2008 Year Of The Jails

<Notes>

Quick aside, if you haven't seen Halt And Catch Fire,
please set aside some time to watch a wonderful historical perspective of modern computing.

The Linux Conatiner Project or LXC's as it became known is created at IBM.
LXC's finally brought user tooling to the world of cgroups, specifically around security.
This was the linchpin that we needed to get to where we are today...

# Docker Makes it Big

<Notes>

Docker is officially given to the Open Container Initiative in June 2015 unified disparate solutions into one initiate.
Docker in itself was _just_ a somewhat improvement over what LXC's introduced years ago.
Better tooling and easier concepts made it trivial for developers to get containers working for them.

1. Docker checked to see if the latest busybox image was available locally
